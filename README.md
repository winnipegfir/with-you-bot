# with-you-bot
An over-engineered counter bot that allows for our controllers to track the "with you" check ins on frequency, as well as the times they have been overstressed while controlling.

This is a Python Discord bot. It was made in Python 3.8 (although, you could probably run it from Python 3.5.3>) with the Discord.py, Python-dotenv, aiomysql dependencies. It also features a database connection (using MySQL) for tracking how many times a specific user has used the commands.

It also has a cron script, that can be used at any frequency you'd like. It runs through your database set of users and checks if they are in the guild, if they aren't, ðŸ‘‹. This is **not necessary** for the bot to run, but it can be good for keeping your database clean.

### Initial Setup
1. Clone the repository
1. Run the following commands:
    1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    1. `python bot.py`
1. Fill in all the fields in `.env` (in the `withyoubot` folder).
1. Run `bot.py` again, it should automatically create a table in the database you supplied in `.env`.
